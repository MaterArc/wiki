    Verification is a feature of postLit that certifies a user being a known
    public figure and not an imposter or parody account. There are requirements
    for being verified that allow the status to be exclusive and remain
    meaningful. postLit's moderation team has the final say in whether or not a
    person receives verification, and it's a privilege that can be taken away if
    a person breaks certain rules or does not deserve verification.

    You can easily recognize a verified user because there is a badge on their
    profiles indicating that they're verified. On the
    <a href="/pages/explore/">explore page</a>.

  <h3>Requirements</h3>
  <p>To ensure that the verification status and icon remain meaningful, it is restricted to popular public figures and postLit users. You can be a developer/maintainer of large projects, an influencer on social media, a government figure, or other things. A full list of minimum requirements are written on the <a href="https://postlit.dev/verification/">verification page</a>.</p>
  <p>While there are minimum requirements for being verified, they aren't the only factor in your path to verification, if you choose to take it. postLit's moderation team has the final say, that way they can make sure that you truly deserve the verification icon. Their decision can also be influenced by followers and invites, as well as activity on the site.</p>
