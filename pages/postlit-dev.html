    <p>postLit is only the coolest social media out there, started in late December of 2022 by a 14-year-old. In just under two weeks, it had over 300 posts and 100 users. It has an amazing community made up of a lot of developers and just teenagers in general.</p>
    <h3>Past versions of postLit</h3>
    <p>postLit is not the first version of the social media known and loved today. While it still started out as postLit v1, it had many lives before it. First, it started out as a chat website for a collaboration on a Scratch project. The project failed, but the website lived on. It turned into "SM", for social media.</p>
    <p>A few more attempts were made at turning "SM" into something bigger. Eventually, around late 2021, the creator made another attempt. The available names for the site were running low due to the many attempts and the fact that each name could only be used once. The new name as "RealSM", for "Real Social Media".</p>
    <p>Many Scratch YouTubers who had been following the project for a long time had started making videos about it. The new website was working out well, and was quickly gaining popularity.</p>
    <div class="warning">
        When the creator of postLit (rgantzos) was in eighth grade developing RealSM, he would sometimes talk to members of his friend group about development, many of which would end up joining the site.

        RealSM was built on Replit, and it was well as all past versions took advantage of Replit's database. However, it was poorly used and would partially lead to RealSM's downfall, as well as just a desire for a clean start with a better look and functionality. So, postIt was born. postIt was a huge jump from RealSM. The UI changed multiple times, but looked good each time- unlike RealSM. Also unlike RealSM, postIt used jsonfile for the database. It had a good admin panel, which RealSM also didn't have.
    </p>
    <p>Eventually, postIt started to fall apart due to the fact that it was using jsonfile, which could get glitchy at times. rgantzos tried to transition the database back over to Replit's database slowly, but it was difficult and the database fell apart, as did the site.</p>
    <p>This leads us to the (likely) final and most amazing version of postLit, postLit itself. After lots of experience, a new database was used and the site was up and running with basic functionality in just under two days of development.</p>
