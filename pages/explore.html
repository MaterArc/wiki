    <p>The explore page holds information about the top activity on postLit. This includes trending posts and top users (users that have the post followers on the website).</p>
    <h3>Top Users</h3>
    <p>The top users section includes the top 12 users with the most followers, going from most to least in followers. Each user on the page can also have up to two icons next to their name- the verification icon and the admin icon. There are usually quite a few users on the top users section that don't have the verification status.</p>
    <p>The top users section is a simple way for new users to find people to follow. When a user first joins postLit, their feed is completely empty. This section helps them to find popular postLit content creators that they can follow to fill up their feed and get them integrated into the community early on.</p>
    <h3>Trending Posts</h3>
    <p>The posts in the trending posts section are the top posts from the selected time period. The default period is from the current day, but you can also choose from the past week or from all time. It sorts the post based on how many likes it has.</p>
    <p>To prevent displaced content, the way that postLit sorts posts on the trending page based on time isn't from the <i>actual</i> last day or week, it's from the past however long that is. So, for days, it's for the past 24 hours. For weeks, it's the past 7 days.</p>
